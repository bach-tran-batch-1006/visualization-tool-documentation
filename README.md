## Description
The Curricula Visualization Tool is used, at a high-level, to provide a color-coded visualization for Revature Sales Representatives to showcase the various skills a certain curriculum (i.e. a batch) has learned through the course of their Revature Training Program. Each visualization is representative of various curricula and the skills they are familiar with. Each skill belongs to a category. Obviously, keeping track of which technologies each curriculum has been trained on can be a daunting task -  that is why we have provided the ability to dynamically add, remove, and edit different skills, categories, and curricula to fit the needs suited at any point in time.
